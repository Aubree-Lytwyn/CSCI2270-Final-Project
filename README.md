Project Summary
	The program is a single-player game, where the player must get from
	Boulder to DisneyLand. They player is a struct to keep track of coins and lives. 
	The player travels along a double linked-list. Each node on the list is a struct
	with different information about what happens to the player at the node.
	The game is a class with different functions to roll the die, move the player, get
	information on each node, and change the lives and coins that the player has. The game
	finishes once the player is at DisneyLand, has run out of lives, or quits the game.
How to Run
	To play the game, download the driver, class, and header files. Run the program and
	follow the instructions in the terminal. Detailed instructions, examples, and a link
	to the project documentation file will be uploaded after Phase2. 
Dependencies
	There are no dependencies.
