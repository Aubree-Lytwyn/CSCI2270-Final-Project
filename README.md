# CSCI2270-Final-Project
CSCI 2270 Recitation 10

Project Summary \n 
	The program is a single-player text game, where the player must get from
	Boulder to DisneyLand. They player is a struct to keep track of coins and lives. 
	The player travels along a double linked-list. Each node on the list is a struct
	with different information about what happens to the player at the node.
	The game is a class with different functions to roll the die, move the player, get
	information on each node, and change the lives and coins that the player has. The game
	finishes once the player is at DisneyLand, has run out of lives, or quits the game. \n
